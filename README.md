# UI for Timesheet Generator

This is a UI for the kit-sdq timesheet generator.
Global settings can be edited via the UI, saving files only saves the month settings.
These saved JSON files are also compatible with the original timesheet generator, so the CLI
can be used as well.

The files can be compiled to tex or directly compiled to a pdf.
